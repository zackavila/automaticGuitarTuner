# automaticGuitarTuner
This is the arduino code I created for am Automatic Guitar tuner I created using an arduino nano. I set up the circuit with the Arduino Nano, a servo motor, a small microhpone, 7 indicator LED's, a push button and a 9V battery. The code includes frequency detection code that I got from amandaghassaei's Instructables page. The code I wrote allows the user to select which string they want to tune by pressing the button. The string you are on is indicated by one of 6 LED's. Then the motor turns either clockwise or counter clockwise depending on the frequency the microphone is picking up until the ideal frequncy is reached. This code worked decently well but the microphone I used was very sensitive and picked up to much background noise making it difficult to acurately tune the guitar. If I could buy a better quatily microphone that was specially designed for guitar sounds I feel that the results could be much better.
